<h1>Hi, feel free to look around</h1>
<p>There's not much to see here, but you're welcome to look! I build curriculum and design learning tools to teach kids Computer Science, and this is where I play with new ideas. I previously lead the curriculum team at Code.org where I worked on lots of tools and curricula (many of which had their start in this playground), and I currently build international CS curricula for Google.</p>
<p>If you're curious, poke around at my <a href="/examples">example projects</a></p>
